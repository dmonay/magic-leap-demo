# Sample React + Redux app

This is an app that I built for one of my contracting clients. I extracted the code that I wrote solely for demonstration purposes.
Please do not share it with anyone under any conditions.

This app consists of a player dashboard. I used React to create modular components and Redux as the store layer for the React architecture.
I wrapped it in a basic Express server for demo purposes. I'm using Webpack for all bundling, SCSS compiling, and ES6 transpiling functionality.
I built the chart components using D3.

To start the app:
1. Make sure you're running at least Node LTS. Easiest way to do that is with nvm: `nvm use --lts`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. Once Webpack is done building, go to http://localhost:8091
